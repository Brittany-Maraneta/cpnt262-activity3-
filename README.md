- w3schools helped me with being able to figure out how to make the text boxes for the username and password. As well as showing me how to input the text after the button is pressed.
- for the capitalization and no white spaces I learnt that when we did our in class activity and Brandon showed me how I'd be able to achieve this.

My main take away is that this assignment I felt a lot more prepared compared to the last one. Only because the in class activity we did with our scrum group really helped me use examples and look through ways of how to do small simpler tasks that I could put in with this assignment. I didn't really understand type=“module” so I had to ask but also compare and contrast what would happen if I use one way or another.
